### CIFAR-10 Inputs

This directory contains 48 input files for the verification on the
CIFAR-10 networks. There are 12 inputs for each perturbation
threshold. The file names are of the form
"image{perturbation_num}_{input_id}".

In each input file, besides the image, the ranges of all input neurons
are given. The target classification is the output neuron whose lower
bound is -1.
